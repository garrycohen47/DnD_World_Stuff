# Why you are here

Redwallow has fallen silent for the past couple of months. Many envoys, scouts, and adventurers have gone out to the city, hoping to see if everything was alright.

But no one has returned.

The bounty to get **any** information from the royal family within Redwallow has increased from 1000 gold to 15000 gold.

Redwallow, home to the Church of the Downtrodden, has contributed to Gothmar's independence from the outside world. Without Redwallow, Gothmar would have to look for help from other bigger countries nearby.

If there is any sort of trouble within Redwallow, it must be saved. **At any cost.**
